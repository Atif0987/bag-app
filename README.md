Laravel Shopify Subscription Bag Rental Service

This is a Shopify Subscription Bag Rental Non-Embeded App using Laravel. I developed the Non-embedded app because of the requirements and technical considerations. If I made this Embedded app, I would face Shopify limitations and restrictions like swap functionality, login user data, user dashboard restrictions, etc.  The app allows users to subscribe to a bag rental service with different subscription plans (3, 6, and 9 months), with an option to swap bags each month for an additional fee. The app integrates with the Shopify API and Stripe and handles subscription management, payment processing, and user dashboard.

Important Note: As I mentioned above, this is a Non-Embedded app so I am unable to provide the direct preview link because local host and Ngrok  for tunneling. So, for a demo, I made a loom video (https://www.loom.com/share/5c95d9553f1f4d2fa330649b4cb23b73)  and other complete details here. However, I give the invitations to the provided emails for the Shopify store.
